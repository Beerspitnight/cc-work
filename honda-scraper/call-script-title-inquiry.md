## Opening Script

**When they answer:**

> "Hi, I'm calling about a 2018 Honda Accord Sport you have listed, stock number TL004554AA. Is someone in sales available to discuss this vehicle?"

**[Wait for transfer/response]**

---

## Title Status Inquiry

**Once connected to sales:**

> "Thanks for taking my call. I'm interested in the 2018 Accord Sport, the red one with 33,000 miles, stock TL004554AA. Before I come in, I need to clarify something.
>
> I ran the VIN through a vehicle history database and it's showing that Carfax does NOT report a clean title on this vehicle. Can you tell me what the title status is?"

---

## Response Scenarios

### Scenario A: "It's a clean title"

**Your Response:**
> "Great, that's good to hear. Can you email me the Carfax report so I can verify that before I drive out? My email is [YOUR EMAIL].
>
> Also, while I have you - the system showed it's not a one-owner vehicle. How many previous owners were there?"

**Follow-up:**
> "And one more question - I noticed the price dropped from $18,990 to $18,790 last week. Is there any additional flexibility on pricing? I'm a serious buyer but I'm comparing several vehicles."

---

### Scenario B: "It has a salvage/rebuilt title"

**Your Response:**
> "I appreciate you being upfront about that. Can you tell me what the damage was and what repairs were done?
>
> Given that it's a salvage title, the pricing would need to reflect that. KBB shows fair market value around $16,800 for a clean title vehicle. For a salvage title, I'd expect to be in the $12,000-$13,000 range. Is that something you can work with?"

**If they push back:**
> "I understand, but salvage titles typically trade at 25-40% below clean title values due to resale concerns and potential financing/insurance issues. I'd need the price to reflect that reality."

---

### Scenario C: "There was an accident but title is clean"

**Your Response:**
> "I see. Can you tell me about the accident - was it minor or major damage? Was it repaired at a certified Honda facility?
>
> I'd need to see the repair records and have my mechanic inspect it before making a decision. Given the accident history, what flexibility is there on the $18,790 price?"

---

### Scenario D: "I don't know, let me check"

**Your Response:**
> "Sure, I'll hold. This is important to me before I make the drive out."

**[If they come back and still don't know]:**
> "I understand. Can you have your sales manager or title clerk pull the actual title and call me back? I'm very interested in this vehicle, but I need to know the title status before proceeding.
>
> My number is [YOUR PHONE NUMBER]. I'm available anytime today."

---

### Scenario E: "Why are you asking about the title?"

**Your Response:**
> "I always research vehicles before buying. I ran this VIN through Marketcheck and it flagged that Carfax doesn't show a clean title. I'm sure there's an explanation, I just need to understand what it is before I visit.
>
> Can you pull the Carfax or check your title documents?"

---

## Transition to Price Negotiation

**If title is confirmed CLEAN, transition to price:**

> "Great, I appreciate you clarifying that. Now, I've done a lot of market research on this vehicle:
>
> - Kelley Blue Book shows fair purchase price around $16,800
> - I see you've already reduced the price once from $18,990
> - The vehicle's been on your lot for about 3 weeks now
>
> I'm prepared to come in today if we can agree on a number. What's your best out-the-door price on this vehicle?"

**[Let them respond first - don't give your number]**

---

## If They Give a Price

**If they say $18,790 firm:**
> "That's the listed price. I was hoping for something closer to $17,000. Can you check with your manager?"

**If they offer $18,000-$18,500:**
> "I appreciate the movement. If you can get to $17,500, I'll come in today and we can finish the paperwork."

**If they offer $17,500-$17,800:**
> "That works. I can be there at [TIME]. Please have the Carfax and any service records ready for me to review."

---

## Closing the Call

**If you're scheduling a visit:**
> "Great, I'll see you at [TIME]. Just to confirm - can you have the following ready for me:
> 1. The Carfax report
> 2. Any service records
> 3. The out-the-door price breakdown in writing
>
> What's your name so I can ask for you when I arrive?"

**If you need to think about it:**
> "Thanks for the information. I'm comparing a few vehicles this week. Can I get your direct number or email in case I have follow-up questions?"

**If the title isn't clean and you're walking away:**
> "I appreciate your time, but with the title situation, this vehicle doesn't work for me. Thanks anyway."
