---

## Primary Negotiation Leverage Points

### 1. Accident History (NEW PRIMARY LEVERAGE)

**What Carfax Shows:**
- Minor damage reported
- Affects resale value
- Must be disclosed to future buyers

**Script:**
> "I pulled the Carfax and see there's a minor accident on record. That affects both the current value and my ability to resell this vehicle later. Buyers always ask about accidents, and I'll have to disclose this. That needs to be reflected in the price."

**Value Impact Argument:**
> "Accident history typically reduces value by 5-10%. KBB shows $16,844 for a clean vehicle - with the accident, fair value is closer to $15,500-$16,000."

---

### 2. Multiple Owners

**Script:**
> "I also noticed this isn't a one-owner vehicle. Combined with the accident history, that raises questions about how it was driven and maintained. Can you provide the full service history?"

---

### 3. Price Already Reduced

**Script:**
> "I see you already dropped the price from $18,990 to $18,790 - that tells me there's room to negotiate. Given the accident history, I think we need to come down further."

---

### 4. Days on Market

**Script:**
> "This vehicle has been on your lot for three weeks now. I'm a serious buyer ready to close today if we can agree on a fair price that accounts for the accident history."

---

### 5. KBB Data

**Script:**
> "Even without the accident, KBB Fair Purchase is $16,844. With the accident disclosure, I should be looking at $15,500-$16,000 range."

---

## Counter-Offer Strategy

### Opening Offer: $15,500

**Script:**
> "I've done my research. The Carfax shows a minor accident, and this isn't a one-owner car. KBB puts clean vehicles at $16,844 - with the accident history, I'm comfortable offering $15,500."

### Counter-Offer Table

| If Dealer Says | Your Counter | Script |
|----------------|--------------|--------|
| $18,790 (no move) | $16,000 | "The accident history is a real issue for resale. I can stretch to $16,000." |
| $18,000 | $16,250 | "I appreciate the movement, but that's still above market for a vehicle with accident history. $16,250." |
| $17,500 | $16,500 | "We're getting closer. $16,500 is fair - that accounts for the low mileage premium AND the accident discount." |
| $17,000 | $16,750 | "Let's split it at $16,750 and close this today." |
| $16,750-$17,000 | **ACCEPT** | This is a win - below your walk-away |
| $16,500 | **ACCEPT IMMEDIATELY** | Excellent outcome |

---

## Fee Negotiation (After Sale Price)

### Current Fees
| Fee | Amount | Target |
|-----|--------|--------|
| Prep Fee | $499 | $0 (waive) |
| Doc Fee | $999 | $499 |
| DMV Fee | $432 | $432 (fixed) |
| Sales Tax | ~$1,180 | ~$1,180 (fixed) |

### Fee Script
> "Now let's talk about fees. The $999 doc fee is almost double the NJ average. And the $499 prep fee should be included - that's just getting the car ready to sell. Can you reduce these?"

**Target Fee Savings:** $500-$1,000

---

## Updated Call Script

### Opening
> "Hi, I'm calling about the 2018 Accord Sport, stock TL004554AA. I've reviewed the Carfax and have some questions before coming in."

### Accident Discussion
> "The Carfax shows minor accident damage. Can you tell me:
> 1. What was the nature of the damage?
> 2. Where was it repaired?
> 3. Do you have the repair records?
>
> This affects my offer, so I need to understand what happened."

### Price Discussion
> "Given the accident history, KBB fair value drops from $16,844 to around $15,500-$16,000. Your asking price of $18,790 doesn't account for that. What's your best price considering the accident disclosure?"

### Closing
> "I'm prepared to come in today if we can agree on a number around $16,500. That's fair - it accounts for the low mileage but also the accident history I'll have to disclose when I sell."

## In-Person Inspection Checklist

Since there's accident damage reported, inspect these carefully:

### Exterior
- [ ] Check panel gaps (misalignment = poor repair)
- [ ] Look for paint overspray on trim/rubber
- [ ] Check for color mismatch between panels
- [ ] Inspect under wheel wells for damage
- [ ] Look at headlight/taillight alignment

### Interior
- [ ] Check airbag warning light (should be off)
- [ ] Verify all electronics work
- [ ] Look for water stains (if front-end damage)
- [ ] Check seatbelt operation

### Mechanical
- [ ] Test drive - any pulling to one side?
- [ ] Listen for unusual noises
- [ ] Check tire wear patterns (uneven = alignment issues)
- [ ] Brake test - does it stop straight?

### Documentation
- [ ] Request repair records
- [ ] Ask which body shop did the work
- [ ] Verify all VIN stickers match (door jamb, dash, engine bay)

## Comparison to Other Vehicles

Given the accident history, compare to your other options:

| Vehicle | Year | Miles | Price | Accident | OTD Target |
|---------|------|-------|-------|----------|------------|
| **This one** | 2018 | 33,406 | $18,790 | **YES** | $18,612-$19,348 |
| 2019 Sport (Mahwah) | 2019 | 72,638 | $18,350 | Unknown | $19,161 |
| 2021 Sport (Mahwah) | 2021 | 78,152 | $18,495 | Unknown | $19,695 |
| 2018 LX (42k mi) | 2018 | 42,034 | $17,999 | Unknown | $18,627 |

### Recommendation

**IF you get this vehicle at $16,500-$17,000:**
- The low mileage (33k) partially offsets the accident history
- Good value at that price point

**IF they won't go below $17,500:**
- The **2019 Sport at $18,350** is a better buy
- Newer year, no known accident, similar OTD

## Final Recommendation

**This vehicle is worth pursuing at the right price.**

- **Low mileage (33k)** is genuinely exceptional and valuable
- **Accident history** should knock $1,000-$1,500 off asking price
- **Target OTD of $18,600-$19,350** makes this competitive with clean-title alternatives

**Bottom Line:** If they won't come below $17,500 on the sale price, walk and buy the 2019 Sport at Mahwah Honda instead - newer year, no accident, similar money.
